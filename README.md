# BVH Visualization

This web application allows users to visualize the hierarchy of bounding volumes (BVH) of a 3D model. The BVH is a tree-like structure that encloses the objects in a scene, and is often used to optimize collision detection and other tasks in computer graphics and physics. 

The software can calculate various properties of the BVH, such as its depth, balance, and efficiency, and display them graphically.
In addition, the software supports the use of a virtual camera to determine the visibility of the polygons in the model from a given viewpoint. The camera's position and orientation can be adjusted interactively, allowing users to explore the scene from different angles and perspectives.

The software is developed using JavaScript, a popular programming language for web development.
